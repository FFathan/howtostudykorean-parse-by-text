                Nouns:
                PLAY반항아 = a rebel

                Notes: “반항하다” translates to “to rebel.” The “아” refers to a child (as in 아기). This word is not used to refer to somebody who is rebelling against a government or society or something like that. Instead, this word is used to refer to a child who rebels against his parents or teachers. To refer to a rebel against society or other things, you can use the word 반역자.

                Examples:
                반항아가 선생님에게 침을 뱉을 뻔 했어요 = The rebel almost spat (spit) at the teacher

                네가 귀신 본 것 같아
                = It looks like you’ve seen a ghost

                귀신이 있는 것을 믿는 사람이 아직도 있어요
                = There are still people that believe in ghosts

                제가 세상에서 제일 무서워하는 것은 귀신이에요
                = The thing I am most scared of in this world are ghosts

                죽은 후에 사람이 귀신이 된다고 믿는 사람이 있어요

                Common Usages:

                태평양에 고래가 있어요 = There are whales in the Pacific Ocean
                캐나다 동부 해변에 가면 고래를 볼 수 있어요 = You can see whales on the eastern coast of Canada

                PLAY늑대 = wolf

                PLAY학위 = a degree (in universities)

                Notes: When referring to a Bachelors, Masters or Doctorate degree, you can place the word 학위 after 학사, 석사 and 박사 respectively. It is also common to not use the word 학위 and simply use the words 학사, 석사 and 박사 by themselves. I guess this would be like the difference between “I got my Master’s” and “I got my Master’s degree” in English.

                Common Usages:
                학사 학위 = bachelor’s degree
                석사 학위 = master’s degree
                박사 학위 = Ph. D
                학위를 따다 = to get/obtain a degree

                Examples:
                학사 학위를 어느 대학교에서 했어요?
                = At which University did you do your Bachelor’s degree?

                저는 박사학위를 따기 위해 5년 동안 노력했어요
                = I worked hard for five years in order to get my doctorate degree

                석사 학위를 끝내는 것은 별로 어렵지 않지만 박사공부를 하는 것은 어려운 편이에요
                = Finishing my Master’s degree wasn’t that hard, but studying for my Ph.D. is quite difficult

                PLAY학사 학위 = bachelor’s degree

                The pronunciation of this word is closer to “학싸 학위”

                Examples:

                = At which University did you do your Bachelor’s degree?

                학사 학위를 하는 것과 석사 학위를 하는 것은 똑같아요
                = Doing your bachelor’s degree and master’s degree is the same

                PLAY석사 학위 = master’s degree

                The pronunciation of this word is closer to “석싸 학위”

                Examples:
                학사 학위를 하는 것과 석사 학위를 하는 것은 똑같아요
                = Doing your bachelor’s degree and master’s degree is the same

                석사 학위를 끝내는 것은 별로 어렵지 않지만 박사공부를 하는 것은 어려운 편이에요
                = Finishing my Master’s degree wasn’t that hard, but studying for my Ph.D. is quite difficult

                PLAY박사 학위 = Ph. D

                The pronunciation of this word is closer to “박싸 학위”

                Notes: In English, a “doctor” can refer to a medical doctor, or a person who holds a Ph.D. You wouldn’t want to call Ph.D. holders “의사” in Korean (unless of course, they happen to also be a medical doctor). Instead, you can call these people “박사님.”

                Examples:
                박사 학위 공부를 다 했어요 = I finished my Ph.D
                박사 학위를 따는 게 잘 되고 있어요? = How is getting your Ph.D. going?
                석사 학위를 끝내는 것은 별로 어렵지 않지만 박사공부를 하는 것은 어려운 편이에요

                Common Usages:
                지식을 얻다 = to acquire/gain knowledge
                지식이 얕다 = to have “shallow” knowledge (to know a lot of things, but to not know them deeply)

                Examples:
                지식이 많은 사람일수록 겸손해요
                = The more knowledge a person has, the more modest they are

                컴퓨터 때문에 많은 지식이 일상에서 중요하지 않아요
                = Because of computers, a lot of intelligence is not important in everyday life

                PLAY비평 = criticism

                Common Usages:
                비평가 = critic.

                PLAY등급 = rating, grade

                Notes: Sino-Korean numbers are used when referring to different ranks.

                Examples:
                우리는 1등급을 받을 뻔 했어요 = We almost received the first ranking
                (Korean students are often placed in a ranking based on their score on an exam. Their actual individual score on the exam is less important. It is more important to get a higher ranking than your peers. More than one person can get a certain rank. For example, there might be four people with the “2nd” rank.)

                소고기는 등급에 따라 가격과 맛이 달라요 = Depending on the grade, the price and taste of beef can be different

                PLAY단추 = button

                Notes: Like in English, 단추 can refer to a button on one’s clothing, or a button that one presses. To refer to the button that one presses, it would also be common to use the word “버튼.”

                Common Usages:
                단추를 풀다 = to unbutton
                단추를 잠그다 = to button up
                단추를 누르다 = to press a button

                = If you don’t start something right from the beginning, things won’t go well later

                Examples:

                = The buttons of that shirt don’t go with the shirt

                = A long time ago there used to be a lot of classrooms that used chalk, but these days they don’t use them much

                The pronunciation of this word is closer to “어근나다”

                Notes: I love this word. It’s hard to translate this into English sometimes, but it can be used to describe many things. Imagine you go to the classroom to find your friend, and she is not there so you leave. Right after you leave, she goes to the classroom to find you. You two are just kind of “out of step” with each other – you couldn’t match the times correctly. This situation describes “어긋나다.”

                I have a picture of the meaning of “어긋나다” in my head. It looks like this:

                Look at the prongs of the box on the top! They could fit perfectly with the holes of the bottom box, but they are just a bit out-of-step with each other. I would say that they are just a little bit “어긋나다” with each other.



                I showed that picture to my wife, and asked her what word she thought I was drawing. Her first guess was “어긋나다.”

                This idea of two things not being matched perfectly can apply to many situations, including personalities, movements, or even bones! For example, the way one describes that they have a fractured bone in Korean is to use the word “어긋나다.”

                Common Usages:
                뼈가 어긋나다 = for a bone to be dislocated
                걸음이 어긋나다 = for one’s steps to not match (usually when two people walk next to each other)

                Examples:
                우리 사이가 어긋나서 싸울 뻔 했어요
                = We don’t get along well (the space between us doesn’t match), so we almost fought

                Introduction

                In this lesson, you will learn how to say “almost” in Korean. The common translation for “almost” in Korean can be “거의,”, but there are cases when you will need to use a special noun. Let’s get started.

                \s

                \s

                Almost: 거의

                The word (거의) in Korean is a very common adverb, and is used very similar to how the word “almost” is used in English. I like distinguishing between usages in my head, so let’s do it right here. 거의 can be used to:

                1) Show that an action is progressing and it has “almost” reached its limit. Once it reaches the limit, it will likely stop. For example:

                PLAY저는 밥을 다 먹었어요 = I ate all the rice
                PLAY저는 밥을 거의 다 먹었어요 = I almost ate all the rice

                Just to point out – by context this type of sentence could be used to have different meanings depending on the context. It could be used to say that you are currently eating and have “almost” eaten all the rice, and will continue to eat (until the rice is gone and you’ve eaten it all). It could also be used to say that you “almost” ate all of the food, but you stopped because you reached some limit (you were full, I guess). There is no way to distinguish these two in Korean without context. However, in English you could translate them differently. In English, you could translate these two to:

                I have almost eaten all the rice
                I almost ate all of the rice

                In Korean, the same sentence would be used to have both of those meanings. You could say the same about the other five examples with “거의” below:

                PLAY저는 숙제를 다 했어요 = I finished all of my homework
                PLAY저는 숙제를 거의 다 했어요 = I almost finished all of my homework
                PLAY저는 숙제를 거의 다 했어요 = I have almost finished all of my homework

                PLAY우리는 다 왔어요 = We are there (we have arrived)
                PLAY우리는 거의 다 왔어요 = We almost arrived (more likely used to mean next example)
                PLAY우리는 거의 다 왔어요 = We have almost arrived

                PLAY분필을 다 썼어요 = I used all of the chalk
                PLAY분필을 거의 다 썼어요 = I almost used all of the chalk
                PLAY분필을 거의 다 썼어요 = I have almost used all of the chalk

                PLAY소화기를 다 썼어요 = I sprayed/shot all of the fire extinguisher
                PLAY소화기를 거의 다 썼어요 = I almost used all of the fire extinguisher
                PLAY소화기를 거의 다 썼어요 = I have almost used all of the fire extinguisher

                PLAY박사 학위 공부를 다 했어요 = I finished my Ph.D.
                PLAY박사 학위 공부를 거의 다 했어요 = I almost finished (the studies of) my Ph.D.
                PLAY박사 학위 공부를 거의 다 했어요 = I have almost finished (the studies of) my Ph.D.

                2) To show that something is just a tad off of some description. For example:

                PLAY저는 화장품이 없어요 = We have no cosmetics
                PLAY저는 화장품이 거의 없어요 = We almost have no cosmetics

                PLAY학사 학위를 하는 것과 석사 학위를 하는 것은 똑같아요
                = Doing your bachelor’s degree and master’s degree is the same
                PLAY학사 학위를 하는 것과 석사 학위를 하는 것은 거의 똑같아요
                = Doing your bachelor’s degree and master’s degree is almost same

                PLAY컴퓨터 때문에 많은 지식이 일상에서 중요하지 않아요
                = Because of computers, a lot of intelligence is not important in everyday life
                PLAY컴퓨터 때문에 많은 지식이 일상에서 거의 중요하지 않아요
                = Because of computers, a lot of intelligence is almost not important in everyday life

                It is also possible to create a third type of sentence using the word 뻔. Let’s talk about this next.

                \s

                \s

                Almost: 거의… ~ㄹ/을 뻔했다

                In the previous section, you saw how “거의” can be used in different ways to mean “almost.” It is also possible to create another type of sentence. In this usage, the action that “almost” happens had not started in any way – and does not happen at all in the future (unless of course, another sentence says that it did).

                Look at the following example, which you saw in the previous section.

                PLAY저는 밥을 거의 다 먹었어요 = I almost ate all the food

                In that sentence, the action that “almost” happened was “eating (all the rice).” However, even though you didn’t eat all of the rice, the action of “eating” was progressing until you hit your limit.

                However, look at the following example:

                저는 거의 넘어졌어요 = I almost fell

                In that sentence, the action of “falling” never started to happen, and in addition will not start to happen. In these cases, you should attach the following to the action that did not occur:

                ~ㄹ/을 뻔 했다.

                For example:

                PLAY저는 거의 넘어질 뻔 했어요 = I almost fell

                This type of sentence describes that the action (in this case, the action of falling) never actually happened despite it “almost” happening.

                The word “뻔” is another one of those pseudo-nouns that actually has no meaning outside of the grammatical form (like “수” in “할 수 있다” (Lesson 45) and “적” in “한 적이 없다” (Lesson 32).

                Below are many more examples:

                PLAY저는 차를 거의 칠 뻔 했어요 = I almost hit that car
                (Before the fact that you almost hit the car, you were not doing the action of “hitting the car”)


                PLAY화가 너무 나서 친구를 거의 때릴 뻔 했어요 = Because I was so mad, I almost punched my friend
                (before the fact that you almost punched your friend, you were not doing the action of “punching your friend”)

                Also note that these sentences don’t necessarily need to have the word “거의” in them. The meaning of “almost” is already embedded within the meaning of “~ㄹ/을 뻔 하다”, so it doesn’t need to be used. However, it is not uncommon to find them used together in Korean sentences.

                PLAY저는 차를 칠 뻔 했어요 = I almost hit that car
                PLAY거미를 보고 죽을 뻔 했어요 = I saw a spider and then almost died
                PLAY우리는 1등급을 받을 뻔 했어요 = We almost received the first ranking
                PLAY화가 너무 나서 친구를 때릴 뻔 했어요 = I was so mad I almost hit my friend
                PLAY반항아가 선생님에게 침을 뱉을 뻔 했어요 = The rebel almost spat (spit) at the teacher

                PLAY우리 사이가 어긋나서 싸울 뻔 했어요
                = We don’t get along well (the space between us doesn’t match), so we almost fought

                PLAY살인자가 사람을 죽인 동기를 말할 뻔 했어요
                = The murderer almost said his motive for killing the person

                PLAY우리 선생님을 모방하는 사람이 진짜 우리 선생님이라고 생각할 뻔 했다
                = The person who impersonated our teacher almost made us think that he was really our teacher
