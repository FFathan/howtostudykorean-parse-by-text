# howtostudykorean-parse-by-text
Parsing every example Korean-english pair with only string input 
(you just need to hard code copy paste it into the String rawText variable), outputting text in terminal.
You can copy paste the results into csv file manually.
I code this to be used on Anki.

Definitely need some work, but for now 90% of the Korean-english pair is usable.
